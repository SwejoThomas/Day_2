            <p class="card-text">
              Located on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, Kannur (fondly known as Cannanore), is a beautiful city bundled
              with a plethora of sightseeing options like beaches, monuments, ancient temples and picnic spots.

              Steeped in the distinctive local art forms like Theyyam, Kannur still has an aura of the bygone colonial
              era. The deep footprints of the Dutch, the Portuguese, the British and the Mysore Sultanate are still
              imbibed into the town and can be witnessed all around.
