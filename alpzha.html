                Situated on the south-western coast of India, Alappuzha is also known by its anglicized name Alleppey.
                Gifted with immense natural beauty, Alappuzha’s backwaters have been the mainstay of Kerala’s tourism.
                Alappuzha port used to be one of the busiest trade centers and traded with the Persian Gulf regions and
                even Europe. Close to Alappuzha lies Kuttanad, the ‘Granary of Kerala’, where farming is done below sea
                level.

                            of the Alleppey backwaters is the overnight journey in the famous Kerala houseboats. These
                            houseboats are as comfortable as any hotel room - sometimes even more luxurious, and as a
                            bonus, you get the open deck.</p>

                            countryside life of Kerala. A special peculiarity of this place is its geography. It lies
                            around 2 metres below the main sea level, making it the lowest altitude place in the
                            country.
